				<h3>About Me</h3>
				<div class="personal_details">
					<p>
						Nice to meet you! My name is Jordan Wendel. I was born and raised on a small farm in Schaller,
						Iowa. I am
						currently a Junior Software Developer
						at Point Comfort Underwriters in Indianapolis, Indiana. I am passionate about learning
						a broad range of languages, technologies, and frameworks all while building things from the
						ground-up
						and making positive impacts on the world in the process.

					<p>
						In 2021, I graduated from Butler University (Go Dawgs!) with a major in
						computer science and a minor in data science. I was also a proud member of Butler's
						baseball team until the fall
						semester of my senior year, where I decided to fiercly pursue my passion for technology and
						development.

				<h3>Volunteering</h3>
				<p>
					Making positive impacts on the community is an important part of who I am. To start my journey,
					I am
					volunteering at <a href="https://fidoindy.org">Fido</a> (Friends of Indianapolis Dogs Outside), a
					fantastic animal advocacy non-profit
					that helps people improve the quality of life for their outside dogs. Their primary areas of
					focus
					are urban,
					low income, higher crime neighborhoods of Indianapolis.
				</p>
				<p>
					My primary focus will be providing technical assistance to their current systems and improving
					their
					website via WordPress. Sharing the knowledge and skills that I have acquired and will gain over
					my
					career not only has positive impacts on my life, but also contributes to something greater than
					any
					one individual.
